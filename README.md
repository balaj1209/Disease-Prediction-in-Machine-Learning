Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
The Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning project aims to develop a predictive model that can diagnose diseases based on patient data. This machine learning application utilizes various algorithms to classify medical conditions based on input features such as symptoms, age, gender, and other relevant factors. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

Features
Disease Classification: Predicts the likelihood of specific diseases based on input data.
Algorithm Support: Implements various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM).
Data Visualization: Provides visualizations to explore and understand the data and model performance.
User Interface: Includes a basic GUI (if applicable) for easy interaction with the model.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy - For numerical operations.
scikit-learn - For implementing machine learning algorithms and metrics.
matplotlib and seaborn - For data visualization.
tkinter - For the graphical user interface (if applicable).
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Note: tkinter is included with the standard Python installation, so you likely don't need to install it separately.

Setup
Data Preparation:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory. The dataset should be in CSV format and include relevant features for disease prediction.
Configuration:

Review the config.py file (if available) to adjust parameters such as dataset paths, model parameters, and other settings.
Model Training:

Run the train_model.py script to train the machine learning models on the provided dataset. This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Model Evaluation:

After training, evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results will be saved to the results/ directory.
User Interface (if applicable):

Run the app.py script to start the GUI for interactive predictions.
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Model Training:

Ensure the dataset is correctly placed in the data/ directory.

Execute the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
The trained model and evaluation results will be saved in the models/ and results/ directories, respectively.

Making Predictions:

For command-line predictions, use the predict.py script. Pass the input features as command-line arguments:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --feature1=value1 --feature2=value2 ...
For GUI-based predictions, launch the application with:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Follow the prompts in the interface to input patient data and get predictions.

Visualizing Data:

Generate and view visualizations by running the visualize.py script:

bash
Copy code
python visualize.py
Troubleshooting
Data Issues: Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and contains all required features. Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Model Performance: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, consider tuning hyperparameters, feature engineering, or trying different algorithms.
Dependencies: Make sure all required Python packages are installed. Check compatibility issues between package versions if errors occur.
